Both designs work without issue on my end, BOM and Gerbers are there along with Eagle files.  
I have included as much info as i think you will need to get one of these up and running without issue.   
The rear adapters are stl files ready for 3d printing, the original design files i couldnt find, but shouldnt be needed.  
No licence, do what you want with the files.

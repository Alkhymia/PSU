Both designs work without issue on my end, BOM and Gerbers are there along with Eagle files.  
I have included as much info as i think you will need to get one of these up and running without issue.   
The rear adapters are stl files ready for 3d printing, the original design files i couldnt find, but shouldnt be needed.  
No licence, do what you want with the files.   

As suggested by someone, here is the links to oshpark. These should be easier for people who have no idea how to get a pcb made but can solder well.

<!-- Now i have that out the way. Here is a little rant for you that checked this file. This shit is what represents just under 2 years of my life, I loved making the Dreamcast version of the psu cause it was new, fun and interesting, i learned so much from doing this, from eagle stuff to taking a labor of love to production and seeing peoples feedback. But the saturn version? I dont think there was one part of the experience that i enjoyed. Which sucks, i really wanted to do the saturn version cause of peoples constant asking for it, emails, tweets, facebook messages, all the time, so i was totally down to do it. But my god what a fucking shit show its turned out to be. From the mess that is saturn revisions to the fucking absolute disgrace that was the indiegogo campaign. There are god knows how many saturn revisions, which i had to try and source hardware for, which by the way is not an easy feat when your relying on ebay pictures to try and work out if you already own that version of the console, let alone the price of those things, most of which i brought non working or "untested", they cost me between Â£20-30 each, and i have no use for them after the final design was done. I dont play the saturn and when i did play it as a kid i wasnt a fan of it to be honest. My love was always the PS1 and the dreamcast. The fuck fest that happened with the campaign was nothing but a nightmare, from the first time the manafacturer screwed me over by increasing a quote by almost 30%, to issues with the cabling design for the top doown saturns and chinas inability to follow basic instructions, to the issues with fake or cloned TI chips. i couldnt beleive it. When i was oriignaly considering the saturn and wether or not i should go ahead and do a campaign for it (which by the way i had to, i know people are like "well what about the money you made from the dreampsu campaign", that dreampsu campaign left me damn near 2k in debt. so there was no money to put towards the saturn stuff besides a few intiial prototypes) i never would have dreamed it would turn out the way it did. I let myself down, everyone who help with the campaign down and everyone who made an order elsewhere down. That shit is not easy to handle when your as mentally fucked as i am lmao. And if your wondering, i dont care if i come across as weird or fucked up here, im drunk and im tired and pissed off, let me rant. Talking of ranting, its SOOOO hard to be nice to people all the time when they are berating you and trying to make you feel like shit (which btw guys, good luck cause i already feel as shit as its humanily possible), I do not envy people in customer service jobs.  OK im probably gonna leave this now before i start rambling, but i will say this, to anyone who has a neat idea or something that will help out the retro community, run at it with full force, make it the best thing you can possibly make it and then for the love of god dont try to sell it to anyone. Release that shit open source and never have to go though the same shit i have with this. I do want to say, once again to everyone that backed this thing, i am sorry from the bottom of my heart, this shit rips me apart every damn day knowing that you guys didnt get what u wanted. Hell i fear checking my phone or emails anytime it makes a noise though fear i have to face one of you again. I would also like to say thank you to everyone that was understanding of the sitation, everyone who offered help or guidance and advice, i cannot thank you enough, i dont want to mention people by names cause that aint fair, but you know who you are, even i replied to your email with not very much in the way of words, or didnt reply at all, i read every single email and bit of adcive you sent and i thank you for that.   Thats it from be folks, If at any point i decide to do another PSU for another console, i wont be selling them in any way shape or form, but i will make the files avaible for people as a further apology to everyone for all that has happened.  -->
